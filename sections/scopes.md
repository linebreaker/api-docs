# Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has. Scopes ending with `_write` include the same scope with `_read` ending, so there is no need to include both, but it will not throw any error if you do.

## Extra (group) scopes

There scopes are just groups, so for example:
1. if you would like your app to access all userâ€™s information you can use just `all_write` scope in your request instead of sending all of the scopes above;
2. if you would like to have read-only access to everything and write access to comments you can use `all_read` scope along with `sitemaps_comments_write`.

**Note:** if, for example, any new `*_write` (or `*_read`) scope will be added in the future and your app requested `all_write` (or `all_read`) you will automatically be granted to access the new scope. Same thing about `sitemap_all_write` (or `sitemaps_all_read`) scope - it will grant access to all new `sitemaps_*_write` (or `sitemaps_*_read`) scopes.
